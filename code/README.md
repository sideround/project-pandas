## Project Description

In this project we are going to clean and manipulate the Shark Attack data set. To put in context, this is a table of shark attack incidents compiled by the Global Shark Attack. 

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset

For this project, you will start with this messy data set <href="https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/1">Shark Attack</a>.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow

We firstly reviewed our dataset to diagnostic potential issues. Then we figure out we should have start removing: 

- Unnamed columns titles (Unnamed: 22, Unnamed: 23).
- NaN cells (Around the data set).
- Duplicated columns (Href formula <> Href).
- Innecessary information (Original order)
- Column name with spaces.

After our period of data cleaning, we ended up with a dataframe which was open to interpretations. In the next section, we will show some insights we got from it.

## Results

Our insights after playing with the data:
- You have more chances to get attacked by a Shark in the USA.
- If you are a male.
- You are 17.
- It is totally unprovoked.
